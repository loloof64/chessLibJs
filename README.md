Developpers
===========

First install NodeJS if not done yet and run `npm install` in order to install dependencies. Then:

* `npm run compile` is useful in order to compile code
* `npm test` launch test units.

Notice that you will also need to install uglifyjs globally.
Also be careful : the compile script use the `mv` command from Linux/Mac. On Windows you may use a tool like CygWin.
